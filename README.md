# diabetes_regression
I have compared different regression technics for the diabete dataset

This a REGRESSION problem.
Ten numeric predictive variables: age, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements. They were obtained for each of n = 442 diabetes patients, as well as the response of interest, a quantitative measure (integer between 25 and 346) of disease progression one year after baseline.

## The goal is to predict as well as possible the future disease progression one year after (target value) as a function of the 10 predictive variables.

Note: Each of the 10 feature variables have been mean centered and scaled by the standard deviation times n_samples (i.e. the sum of squares of each column totals 1).
